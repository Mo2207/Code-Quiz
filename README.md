# Javascript Code-Quiz

## Description:
  
This quiz is a minigame that has a few basic javascript questions that you need to answer on a timer. The users score is tracked and can be added to the scoreboard at the end.
  - My motivation for this project was to gain a general understanding of how a basic game works.
  - I built this code quiz minigame to practise using localStorage to store data.
  - Building this project I learned how to change html elements using javascript (making them visible/invisible).
